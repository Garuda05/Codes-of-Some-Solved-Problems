It is very informative as we follow her tending an actual perennial garden; a great concept. Mistakes and all, we see the problems, challenges, and joys of perennial gardening the way most of us do it. From early spring cleanup, to plant division, to weeding, plant choice and more, this is an excellent book for those who have a perennial garden, or those who are considering one.
